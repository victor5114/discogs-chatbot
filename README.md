# discogs-bot

## TODO
- [x] Test SNS publish
- [] Move Oauth code from dispatcher to slack Oauth function (Not sure Oauth will be used)
- [] Test and query Discogs API
- [] Move Terraform dependencies in an other folder and use terraform remote storage to separate what's needed before Discogs Lambda Application bootstrap and what can be created afterward.
